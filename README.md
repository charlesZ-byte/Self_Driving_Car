[![INSERT YOUR GRAPHIC HERE](Self-driving.png)]()

- Deep Q-Learning is the result of combining Q-Learning with an Artificial Neural Network.
- The states of the environment are encoded by a vector which is passed as input into the Neural Network.
- Then the Neural Network will try to predict which action should be played, by returning as outputs a Q-value for each of the possible actions. Eventually, the best action to play is chosen by either taking the one that has the highest Q-value, or by overlaying a Softmax function.

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/charlesZ-byte/Self_Driving_Car.git`

### Setup

- If you want more syntax highlighting, format your code like this:

> update and install this package first

```shell
$ brew update
```

> now install npm and bower packages

```shell
$ npm install

## FAQ

- **How do play the car model?**
    - It is easy, just draw the path from top left to bottom right, the car will learn itself, isn't is cool?
